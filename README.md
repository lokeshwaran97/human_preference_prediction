# Chatbot Preference Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict which responses users will prefer in a head-to-head battle between chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs). The dataset consists of conversations from the Chatbot Arena, where different LLMs generate answers to user prompts. The objective is to develop a machine learning model that can predict user preferences, thereby improving the alignment of chatbot responses with human preferences.

Ensuring that LLM responses resonate with users is critical for successful interaction. This competition presents a unique opportunity to tackle this challenge with real-world data and help bridge the gap between LLM capability and human preference.

## Project Description

In this competition, participants are challenged to predict user preferences for chatbot responses. The data is collected from Chatbot Arena, where users chat with two anonymous LLMs and choose their preferred answer. The goal is to build a model that can predict which response a user will prefer in these head-to-head battles.

This challenge is related to "reward models" or "preference models" in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Previous research has shown that directly prompting an existing LLM for preference predictions can have limitations due to biases such as position bias, verbosity bias, and self-enhancement bias.

Participants are encouraged to explore various machine-learning techniques to build an effective model for predicting user preferences. The successful model will help in developing LLMs that can tailor responses to individual user preferences, leading to more user-friendly and widely accepted AI-powered conversation systems.

## Steps Taken in the Code


1. **Library Imports**: Import necessary libraries for data processing, model building, and evaluation.
2. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset containing conversations from the Chatbot Arena.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values, tokenization, and preparing the data for model training.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create features that will be used as inputs for the model. This may include encoding the responses, extracting relevant metrics, and handling biases.
5. **Model Building**: Define and compile a neural network model using Keras and TensorFlow. This includes specifying the architecture, loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics.
6. **Model Training**: Train the model on the preprocessed dataset. This step includes defining the training loop, setting hyperparameters, and monitoring the model's performance.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model on a validation set to assess its performance. This includes calculating accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
8. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data and determine which chatbot response is preferred by users.
9. **Results and Analysis**: Analyze the results, identify potential areas for improvement, and iterate on the model as necessary.


## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive approach to predicting user preferences in chatbot responses. By developing a robust machine learning model, we can enhance the interaction between chatbots and users, ensuring that the responses align better with human preferences. The steps outlined in the code serve as a foundation for building and improving such models, contributing to the advancement of AI-powered conversation systems.
